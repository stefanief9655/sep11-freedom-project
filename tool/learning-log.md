# Tool Learning Log

Tool: Hammer.js

Project: **X**

---

10/27/23
Explored the Hammer.js documentation
* Has many uses to recognize touch guesture
* The hammer.js library has all the variables to recognize the gesture
* https://hammerjs.github.io/jsdoc/

10/29/23:
* Watched tutorial. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHSbJmKvGJo
  * Learned that hammer.js can be applied to a word and send alerts when you preform an action on it such as clicking it or trying to drag it.
  * You can have it preform a function when the action is detected.

11/05/23
* Researched other tools and switched my tool
  * Math.js is a math code that can do math with fractions
  * Fractions are the prefered measument I want so its easier to read the recipe

12/04/23
* I explored the rest of the things I can do with math.js. I decided the only thing I will use it for is fractions.
* I studied and added to my sandbox for math.js.
  * ``` js
    // functions and constants
    print(math.fraction('1/3'));    // 1/3
    print(math.multiply(math.fraction('1/4'), math.fraction('1/2'))) // 1/8
    print(math.log(10000, 10));                  // 4
    print(math.sqrt(-4));                        // 2i
    ```
    * This is some of what I learned

12/13/23

* Looked at possible things math.js can be used to create.
* Practiced using the multiply part of math.js to see how I will utlize it in my freedom project.

01/30/24

* Researched common errors found when using Math.js
* Spelling issues that cause errors
* Use the wrong Arithmetic functions for what your trying to do

03/02/24
* Tinkered with my tool and combined it with DOM to practice it before adding it to my freedom project.

03/08/24
* Added my tool to my project. I didn't work. Spelling is really important.
  * Spelling `fraction` as `fratcion` doesn't work. No autocorrect and it can't just guess what I meant.


### Questions
* Will this make my freedom project easier to create or will it end up taking more time then a possible other tool?
