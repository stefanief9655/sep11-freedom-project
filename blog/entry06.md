# Entry 6
##### 05/30/24

The year is almost over. My project is submitted and the expo is done. I've learned so much this year. This project has had a lot of ups and downs and through it all the most important thing I've learnt is that it is so so so important to manage your time. I had so many different ideas for my project but couldn't do them all because I didn't use my time wisely. [My project](https://stefanief9655.github.io/sep11-freedom-project/) functions but there are visual aspects that I wish looked better. It was also really important for me to embrace my failures. I faced many issues trying to ensure no information was being lost.

### Takeaways 
* Elevator Pitch - Writing my elevator pitch was very important. Without it I would have been unprepared for the expo. I wouldn't know where to start with my presentation to the judges or what information was important for me to include. If I were to get rejudged and had to rewrite my elevator pitch I would add another question to my presentation to give the listener more of an interaction with my project. I was definetly nervous to present to the judges but having written an elevator pitch and having practiced it less stressful.
* In class presentation - I was less nervous about this then my elevator pitch but paniced as soon as I stood up infront of the class. Having only the key information on the slides made it easier. When making slides, you don't want the viewer to just see a wall of text. As the presenter, looking down and seeing a lot of information at once makes me overwhelmed. From this experience I learned that preparation is key.
