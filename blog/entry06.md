# Entry 6
##### 05/30/24

The year is almost over. My project is submitted and the expo is done. I've learned so much this year. This project has had a lot of ups and downs and through it all the most important thing I've learnt is that it is so so so important to manage your time. I had so many different ideas for my project but couldn't do them all because I didn't use my time wisely. [My project](https://stefanief9655.github.io/sep11-freedom-project/) functions but there are visual aspects that I wish looked better. It was also really important for me to embrace my failures. I faced many issues trying to ensure no information was being lost.

### Takeaways 
* Elevator Pitch - Writing my elevator pitch was very important. Without it I would have been unprepared for the expo. I wouldn't know where to start with my presentation to the judges or what information was important for me to include. If I were to get rejudged and had to rewrite my elevator pitch I would add another question to my presentation to give the listener more of an interaction with my project. I was definetly nervous to present to the judges but having written an elevator pitch and having practiced it less stressful. [This is my notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hRdnEL7YLE-kn-GS4W6lYa6W13XSrpzSsTmAo7gb9Zc/edit) and in here you will find my unit notes as well as the final draft of my elevator pitch and the plan for my presentation. 
* In class presentation - I was less nervous about this then my elevator pitch but paniced as soon as I stood up infront of the class. Having only the key information on the slides made it easier. When making slides, you don't want the viewer to just see a wall of text. As the presenter, looking down and seeing a lot of information at once makes me overwhelmed. From this experience I learned that preparation is key. [This is my presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1aGLg2rlm56QffEBnOorloef8Q5hzRDzoU2v0tIsy0d0/edit#slide=id.g2dde88e5534_4_249). In the slides you will see the purpose of my project. I didn't want to make a game like most people because I wanted my project to have a purpose. You'll also see how I included loops, conditionals, and my tool. As well as my biggest take aways. The skill of googleing can in very handy for this project to help debug the code since I was the only student using my tool. I was able to find websites where people had similar issues to me and see the ways they used trial and error to debug. 

  
### EDP
This was the final step of the EDP, the communication step. My presentation in class anf my elevator pitch at the expo were my ways of communicating my final project.
