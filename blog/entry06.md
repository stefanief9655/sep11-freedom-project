# Entry 6
##### 05/30/24

The year is almost over. My project is submitted and the expo is done. I've learned so much this year. This project has had a lot of ups and downs and through it all the most important thing I've learnt is that it is so so so important to manage your time. I had so many different ideas for my project but couldn't do them all because I didn't use my time wisely. [My project](https://stefanief9655.github.io/sep11-freedom-project/) functions but theres visual aspects that I wish looked better. It was also really important for me to embrace my failures. I faced many issues trying to ensure no information was being lost.
