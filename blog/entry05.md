### Engineering Design Process

I have now completed step 6 of the EDP which is to Test my project. I have created my MVP or minimun valued product. While it does what I want it to, there are always improvments to be made. Such as formatting. Making it more appealing. Or extending it and adding more recipes as right now it only has 1. This would all be considered step 7 of the EDP which is to Improve. After that all thats left in this process is to share my project with my community. 

### Skills

I frequently used the skill of debugging during the creation process. I spent a lot of time debugging my functions to ensure no key information was lost when the function was ran. At first when the button was pressed to double the recipe, it would only display the measurement. For example, the origional would say "1/2 cup unsalted butter", and then after the button was pressed it would only say "1" with no unit of measurement or ingredient name. For the sake of a recipe, this was not very practical. What I learnt was that I would need code in my function that would identify the unit and ingredient of each list item and reuse it when rewriting that line.
