# Entry 3
##### 02/05/24

My learning hasn't been a lot of practicing. Instead, memorizing how to use my tool. I practiced my tool and chose how I plan to us it for my freedom project. I could use math.js in multiple ways. Either with fractions or decimals. Regardless I can ensure the final number is displayed as a fraction. I want it as a fraction for easier reading and understanding. When you can understand the recipe its easier to make and less likely to mess up.

If I write the math using decimals it will be simpliar in the code since its more readable for me then inproper fractions. According to [math.js docs](https://mathjs.org/docs/datatypes/fractions.html), sometimes the answer would also display as a decimal but by using `math.fraction()`. This will display anything done in the `()` as a fraction

For example,
```js
print(math.divide(1.5, 2)) // number, .75
print(math.fraction(1.5 / 2)) // 3/4
print(math.fraction(0.125 * 2)) // Fraction, 1/4
print(math.fraction(0.32 * 3)) // Fraction, 24/25
print(math.fraction(.33 * .5)) // Fraction, 33/200
print(math.fraction('0.(3)')) // Fraction, 1/3
```
* When  `math.divide` was used, it displayed it as a decimal but when you divide the same numbers in `math.fraction`, it displays the fraction.
    * In terms of a recipe, fractions are less complex then decimals.

## Next Steps

My next steps are to actually integrate this into my project. I have the base of the html written. Now I need to make the math opperation functions. These will then be combined with DOM strategies to make my website interactive. I'd say for now I know what I need to know about my tool for my project. There's no other information I need for my [MVP](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tdcRKZRCZbQHeDqc7xPYZlNnlt-2lSDMCVYXop_8C24/edit?usp=sharing).


## EDP

My current progress is still in the planning portion of the Engineering Design Process (EDP). I have mapped out how I plan to code this project and previously researched everything I should need for it. Next I will focus on the creating aspect of the EDP. This is when I will really start involving my tool and fufilling the purpose of my project.




## Skills

Since my last entry I have focused on the skills of problem decomposition and consideration. I has taught me the importance of breaking tasks down into smaller tasks. This project is very intimidating but once its broken into smaller projects it lessens the intimidation. I also know that my intention is for this to be used by other people. In order for that to happen, I have to take into account that people of all different skill sets could use this so it is important it is functional to a larger demographic of people.
