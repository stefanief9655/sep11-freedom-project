### Choosing my project and tool
##### 11/06/2023

I want my project to serve a purpose. A possible idea I have that I know I would use is a website, maybe app (in the future) that would allow you to store recipes for different things that would also have a function that could give you the measurements based on how much of said food you need. For example if you have a cookie recipe and only want to make 2 dozen cookies, it would give you the measurements that if followed correctly would make you 2 dozen cookies. Or just a button that would cut the recipe in half, double it or even triple it.

Originally I intended on using Hammer.js. I thought [Hammer.js](https://hammerjs.github.io/) would be helpful because Hammer.js has a .press function that I think would be helpful for coding the buttons to actually do the math, and after more research and tinkering I would be able to include it in my code. After feedback from Mr.Mueller, I learned that in class I would be learning a way to do this, so I chose to choose a tool that would help with something else. 

After tinkerng, decided to switch to [math.js](https://mathjs.org/index.html). When you read a recipe, you always see measurements written in fractions, not decimals. Math.js has the ability to do the math of multiplying the recipe or dividing it, while using and returning fraction measuements. 

Using `print(math.fraction('1/3'));` will display the fraction.

Using `print(math.multiply(math.fraction('1/4'), math.fraction('1/2')))` will multiply the fractions together and return the value as the fraction of 1/8.

I would say I focused a lot on the skill of how to read. Picking a tool was an important decision and I definetly wanted to do a lot of research before commiting to one. Reading the documentation is very different then reading a regular book. I needed to make sure it made sense and was actually going to help me with my project, and after research I think math.js will be helpful. It will help the user read the website more easily. 

This was the first 2 steps of the Engineering Design Process. Step 1 is defining and step 2 is researching. I defined what i want my project to be and I researched tool options for said project.
