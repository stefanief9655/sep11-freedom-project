#### Math.js

 I am using math.js to write the measurments for recipes in fraction form. I have tinkered with the fractions and learned how to add, subtract, multiply and divide them.

 ``` js
print(math.fraction('1/3'));    // 1/3
print(math.multiply(math.fraction('1/4'), math.fraction('1/2'))) // 1/8
```
This prints what you see to the right of the `//` on the screen. Other functiosn can be seen [here.](../toolTinker1/index.html) I Learned this from the [Math.js](https://mathjs.org/docs/datatypes/fractions.html) Docs. The multiplication aspect of my project will most likely be done with the code above.

My goal for my freedom project over break is to get all the information in the file. I will also start to learn how bittons work so I can make the recipes customizable. The buttons will be displayed on the screen so you can select either the origional recipes, a double batch or even a triple batch. It will tell the code to multiply the ingredients and give the user the measurements needed.

### Skills

During this process I used my skills of googling to help me completely understand how to use the different fraction functions of math.js. This will allow me to not only write the recipes with fractions but also also the products of the multiplication to be written as fractions. I also used the skill of growth mindset to help myself be patience and to not give up when something was difficult. I found the issue and took the time to understand it and correct it.

### EDP

I am currently in the planing step of the Engineering Design Process. I am planning how I will utilize my tool in my project and how I will pace myself to complete this project well. Planning is an important step, without a plan theres no way of keeping track of everything you will need to do or how to get it done by a deadline.
