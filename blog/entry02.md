#### Math.js

 I am using math.js to write the measurments for recipes in fraction form. I have tinkered with the fractions and learned how to add, subtract, multiply and divide them.

 ``` js
print(math.fraction('1/3'));    // 1/3
print(math.multiply(math.fraction('1/4'), math.fraction('1/2'))) // 1/8
```
This prints what you see to the right of the `//` on the screen. Other functiosn can be seen [here](../toolTinker1/index.html)The multiplication aspect of my project will most likely be done with the code above.

My goal for my freedom project over break is to get all the information in the file. I will also start to learn how bittons work so I can make the recipes customizable. The buttons will be displayed on the screen so you can select either the origional recipes, a double batch or even a triple batch. It will tell the code to multiply the ingredients and give the user the measurements needed.
