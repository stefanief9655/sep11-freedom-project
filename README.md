# SEP11 Freedom Project
by **Stefanie Flannery**

## Context
I am a student at [HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/) in the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/). The "Freedom Project" for SEP11 is a year-long project all about making something using JavaScript along with a third-party JS tool.

For my project, I chose to independently study **math.js** in order to help me make a website that can store the recipes I use to make the cookies all my friends like. Not only does it store them but it also as the feature to multiply or divide the recipe measurements.
